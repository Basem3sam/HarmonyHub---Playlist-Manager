## ⚙️ Implementation  

At the core of **HarmonyHub** is the **Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)**, a robust data structure that ensures efficient navigation and modification of the playlist.  

### Why CDLL?  
1. **Cyclic Nature**: Ideal for playlists that loop back to the start.  
2. **Bidirectional Traversal**: Navigate seamlessly in both forward and backward directions.  
3. **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficient addition and removal of songs.  

### How It Works  
- Each song is represented as a **node**, storing attributes like title, artist, genre, album, year, and duration.  
- The **list is circular**, where the last node points back to the first, forming a loop.  
- **Bidirectional links** allow smooth transitions in either direction.
